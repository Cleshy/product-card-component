## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

After a long time, I just started on projects. I also started with JavaScript, but I felt I needed to practice HTML and CSS before I started something big. I did not regret the decision. This small project also made me realize that I should not rush, and practicing is the best way to really keep the knowledge I have already gained.
